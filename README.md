*examples*
```bash
$ java -jar scio-api-0.1.0-standalone.jar -c /opt/scio/scio.ini
```

```bash
$ SCIOAPIINI=/opt/scio/scio.ini java -jar scio-api-0.1.0-standalone.jar
```

## Configuration

*Consider sharing the .ini file between scio and scio-api*

```ini
[beanstalk]
queue = submit
host = localhost
port = 11300

[elasticsearch]
host = http://localhost:9201 http://localhost:9202

[storage]
storagedir = /tmp

[api]
port = 3000
```

### [beanstalk]

*queue*: This is the beanstalk tube shared by scio-api and scio. This is where scio retrieves the filenames
to scrape for indicators.

*host*: The hostname of the beanstalkd service

*port*: The ports running the beanstalkd service

### [elasticsearch]
*host*: A list of hosts separated by space. This is the list of *coordinators* in the case of a cluster.

### [storagedir]

*storagedir*: The directory where the submitted documents are stored. This can be the same place as scio stores the documents. *Important: scio must be able to read the files in this directory*

### [api]
*port*: The port the web API will be listening on.

## Tests using curl to verify everything works

### Submitting data

The Content-Type *MUST* be "application/json"
The data must be a json map with the keys "content" containing the file content as base64 and "filename" containing the basename of the file.

```bash
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{"content": "MTI3LjAuMC4xCg==", "filename": "testfile.txt"}' http://localhost:3000/submit
{"error":null,"filename":"/tmp/testfile.txt","bytes":10}‚èé
$
```

### Downloading data

```bash
$ curl 'http://localhost:3000/download?id=77785fc7b151a325a39d2c40a7701cb57736f2ce34b7edbef4e538f42c1509d3'
{"filename":"testfile.txt","content":"MTI3LjAuMC4xCg==","encoding":"base64"}
$
```
